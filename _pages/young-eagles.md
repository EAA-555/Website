Founded in 1992, the Young Eagles program is dedicated to giving youth ages 8–17, an opportunity to go flying in a general aviation airplane.
These flights are offered free of charge and are made possible through the generosity of EAA member volunteers.

It’s the only program of its kind, with the sole mission to introduce and inspire kids in the world of aviation.
Today, the Young Eagles program has flown over 2 million kids.

You Are Never Too Young to Love Aviation!
