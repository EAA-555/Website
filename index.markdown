**EAA Chapter 555** invites you to visit and enjoy many opportunities to meet aviation enthusiasts whether you fly, build, restore or simply enjoy airplanes and aviation in general.
Our members and guests are able to meet aviation enthusiasts, aircraft builders, pilots, and like minded people to share ideas, ask questions, exchange information, learn about and encourage safety, be involved in and serve the aviation community - and have fun doing so.

Our Chapter is known as the **Triple Nickel** and hosts many social events and seminars for folks of all ages.
Youth programs encourage interest in aviation and aeronautical opportunities.

As we move forward into 2023, we continue building our website to provide you with information on events as they become available.
Be sure to check the Event Calendar on the website often

The most difficult thing is the decision to act: the rest is just tenacity.
The fears are paper tigers. You can do anything you decide to do.**
